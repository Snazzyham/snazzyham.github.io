# Hi, this is the code for my new website. 

Well not really my new website, thats currently hosted on a ghost blog, but I'm trying to move it to Github pages because that's what all the cool kids are doing. 

I forked this off [John Otander's Pixyll](http://pixyll.com) and heavily customised it.  

I'm basically using a combination of basscss _(which is what the repo came with)_, Tachyons _(for the homepage and left-post layout)_ and some of my own utility classes. I know, it's messy.
