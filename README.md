# ***UPDATE***
This website is really old. Well, the information has been updated, but the site itself is really old, built when I was just a newbie at web development and is in no way a reflection of my skillset. I do hope to upgrade it, but I'll do that when I either find the time, or the right idea. 

I really don't like this website. For now however, it'll [have to do](https://media.giphy.com/media/P8yIb9Hqib7tm/giphy.gif).

# Hi, this is the code for my new website. 

Well not really my new website, thats currently hosted on a ghost blog, but I'm trying to move it to Github pages because that's what all the cool kids are doing. 

I forked this off [John Otander's Pixyll](http://pixyll.com) and heavily customised it.  

I'm basically using a combination of basscss _(which is what the repo came with)_, Tachyons _(for the homepage and left-post layout)_ and some of my own utility classes. I know, it's messy. 

<small>Special thanks to Natt for the gif on the homepage.</small>
