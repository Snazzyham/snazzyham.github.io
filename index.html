        <p>I&#39;m currently a Full Stack Web Developer at <a href="https://goodstuph.org">GOODSTUPH</a> in Singapore, working on some pretty cool stuph (pardon the pun) with some dope clients. I enjoy functional javascript, atomic css and playing video games on a screen that's way bigger than it needs to be.</p>

        <p>In a past life I was a writer, and had been published by Thomson Reuters, Forbes, Tech in Asia and The Jakarta Globe, to name a few.</p>

        <p>As part of our third year IT project at Latrobe, my team and I built <a href="http://metrobe.info">Metrobe</a>. You can read about why we did what we did <a href="https://medium.com/@SnazzyHam/the-year-long-process-to-change-the-way-public-transport-was-perceived-at-la-trobe-university-5c78a758f395#.sc71razho">here</a>. I&#39;m also really into contributing to Open Source projects, which you can keep track of on my <a href="https://github.com/snazzyham">GitHub</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="mailto:snazzyham@gmail.com">Email me</a> if you&#39;d like to talk or go grab a coffee, I&#39;m always up to meeting new people.</p>
